# MetaModeling UX (MMUX)

This repository contains various elements necessary to run MMUX pipelines oriented to specific workflows, as well as the functions used to craft them.

- iframe applications, set up with Streamlit, for GUI-based interaction
- python scripts for computational pipeline execution & debugging
- utility functions (ported from mmux-utils)

This repository also includes various tooling (code formatting, styling, static type checking, pre-commit hooks, testing, ...) based on the [S4L Python Template](https://git.speag.com/itis/s4l-python-template).

Moreover, it follows a [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD)  approach to code development to enforce clean, clear, minimalist code.
